# tower-of-hanoi-c
This project serves as a college homework. A simple C program that solves the classic Tower of Hanoi problem using recursion.
The program allows the user to specify custom rod names and the number of disks, then outputs each step required to move the disks from the source rod to the destination rod, following the game rules.

💡 Features:
Recursive implementation of the Tower of Hanoi algorithm

Custom rod labels (user-defined)

Counts and displays each move with step numbers

Displays total number of moves at the end

📌 Example:
Editează
Enter the letter for the source rod: A
Enter the letter for the destination rod: C
Enter the letter for the auxiliary rod: B
Enter the number of disks: 3

Steps to solve Tower of Hanoi:

Step 1: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C
Step 2: Move disk 2 from rod A to rod B
...
Step 7: Move disk 1 from rod A to rod C

Total number of moves: 7
🛠️ Technologies:
C (compiled with GCC or any standard C compiler)
Console input/output

🔖 Use case:
Perfect for beginners learning recursion or those interested in solving classic algorithm problems in C.
